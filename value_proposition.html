		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		<p>Our project was focused on establishing communication pathways between Canopii’s robotics interface, and its sensors. Previously, no such pathways existed, making it inconvenient to read sensor data. </p>
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>Our target audiences are Canopii’s technicians, and future users. By adding communication pathways between Canopii’s robot interface and sensors, we’ve reduced the number of required interfaces. This makes it easier on the people who have to interact with the sensors and robots in the Greenhouse. Additionally, having all of the sensor data in one place has enhanced Canopii’s potential for automation.</p> 
		<h2>Core Features</h2><p>
		It is now possible for Canopii to track a plant with an RFID tag throughout the greenhouse, and read sensor data from the main interface. Our project has made it easier for technicians to access the sensor data that they need, as they are no longer required to look at a specific interface for a specific sensor.</p>
