    <p>
      This project was developed using only a few technologies, the primary
      being ROS 2, which is the foundation for the greenhouse automation system.
      The other key technology is the Modbus communication protocol, using the
      Python library PyModbus. This communication protocol enables connectivity
      between commercial off-the-shelf hardware devices and our developed software
      system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our software is designed to sit between the off-the-shelf components and
      Canopiiâ€™s proprietary control software, allowing for more automated control
      over the greenhouse systems. At the core of our component is a ROS 2 node
      that maintains connections to the off-the-shelf components using the Modbus
      TCP protocol. Using these connections, it reads the current state of the 
      device and makes it accessible to the other ROS 2 nodes within the network
      through a published ROS 2 topic. Aside from reporting the device states,
      it allows for commands to be sent with ROS 2 (via ROS 2 service calls)
      to update the states of devices and ultimately use this to provide more
      automated control the the greenhouse.

    <h1>Development Challenges and Solutions</h1>

    <p>
        One of our primary challenges faced when working on this project was the 
        ability to test against the hardware itself. The first route that our team 
        had taken to achieve testing against these three Modbus-capable modules 
        was to create simulators for each of them. Matching as closely as possible 
        to the hardware itself gave us the ability to test our module abstractions 
        for reading and writing data. This gave us a safe way to test our 
        implementation before connecting to the hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our project partner set up a stable connection to a testing environment that 
        he specifically set up for our team. This testing environment was separated 
        from the main greenhouse functionality, which was also connected to the test 
        hardware. In the beginning, only the Stride I/O Module was connected to our 
        testing environment. This left the Agrowtek GCX greenhouse controller and the
        IO-Link Master hardware to be tested later in development. The Stride I/O Module
        had two inputs looping back to their respective outputs, allowing us to assess
        some but not all of the functionality against the hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        The next addition to the testing environment was the IO-Link Master which was 
        specifically being used with a radio frequency identification tag sensor(RFID). 
        Once set up there was a need for coordination with our project partner to 
        accomplish proper testing to ensure that the sensor was updating the placement 
        and removal of the RFID tag within the response time of 0.2 seconds requested 
        by our project partner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our project partner currently only has one Agrowtek GCX greenhouse controller, 
        which is in service in the greenhouse. Our team needed to avoid hindering 
        greenhouse development, this was our primary concern when testing. Coordination 
        with our project partner allowed us to begin testing against this module, where 
        we also ran into a Modbus connectivity issue. The Agrowtek GCX greenhouse 
        controller, unlike the other two modules, has a setting within the physical 
        interface that had to be toggled to allow Modbus connections to be established.
    </p>

    <p>
        There was also the issue with the register addresses being off by one within the
        documentation versus the hardware itself. The registers are locations where the 
        data from connected sensors to these modules is stored. After some testing against 
        hardware, a minor adjustment to the register values within our module abstractions 
        solved our addressing issue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once our code was merged into our main branch, we consistently failed automated 
        tests. These tests consisted of spinning up a simulator and running a test script
        of our module abstractions against it. These test scripts were failing to connect 
        to the simulators due to a timing issue. The automated testing environment was a 
        tad too slow when spinning up the simulator which caused the test script to fail 
        on connection attempt. A simple fix of adding a wait on connection attempts and a
        set number of retries solved this issue.
