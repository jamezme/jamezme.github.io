    <h1>Technical Implementation</h1>

    <p>
      This project was developed using only a few technologies, the primary
      being ROS 2, which is the foundation for the greenhouse automation system.
      The other key technology is the Modbus communication protocol, using the
      Python library PyModbus. This communication protocol enables connectivity
      between commercial off-the-shelf hardware devices and our developed software
      system.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our software is designed to sit between the off-the-shelf components and
      Canopiiâ€™s proprietary control software, allowing for more automated control
      over the greenhouse systems. At the core of our component is a ROS 2 node
      that maintains connections to the off-the-shelf components using the Modbus
      TCP protocol. Using these connections, it reads the current state of the 
      device and makes it accessible to the other ROS 2 nodes within the network
      through a published ROS 2 topic. Aside from reporting the device states,
      it allows for commands to be sent with ROS 2 (via ROS 2 service calls)
      to update the states of devices and ultimately use this to provide more
      automated control the the greenhouse.
