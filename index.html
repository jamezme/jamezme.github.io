    <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to make it easier for different machines in Canopii’s automated greenhouse to talk to each other. We did this by connecting a common communication method used in industry—Modbus TCP—with the robotics software system ROS2. This helps all the devices in the greenhouse, like sensors and automated machines, share information smoothly and work together efficiently.</p>
    <p>Modbus TCP is a standard protocol used for industrial devices, while ROS2 is a modern software platform used for building robot systems. By integrating Modbus TCP into ROS2, we bridge the gap between industrial hardware and robotic control software—making automation in the greenhouse more reliable and scalable.</p>

        <h3>Who is Canopii?</h3>
        <p style="width:400px">Canopii is a start-up located in Oregon who aims to automate farming in a sustainable and affordable way. We worked directly with their full-scale prototype and software team to complete this project. See more info on Canopii on their <a href="https://www.canopii.us">website</a>.</p>
